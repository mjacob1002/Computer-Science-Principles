1. Retrieve the site name
2. get the length of the site
3. reverse the site name
4. compute lengthOfSite mod 10 and then hit Shift + that number
5. Compute the factorial of the length of the site
7. Password is reversed site name with the special character in step 4 at the end. Next, append the length of the site at the end of the password. Finally, append the size of the site factorial to the end of the password. 

Example:

site name is: facebook
length of the site is: 8
reverse facebook: koobecaf
compute length mod 10: *
Compute size!: 40320
create password: koobecaf*840320.
